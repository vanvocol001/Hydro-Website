						<h2>Saw 1</h2>
						<p>"I believe a good attribute for a saw operator would be the ability to 
							troubleshoot problems as they occur. Another skill a good saw operator 
							would need is the ability to work alone unsupervised."</p>
						
						<p>Saw Operator 1 is responsible for operating and maintaining saw equipment to 
							cut and process materials to precise specifications while ensuring adherence 
							to safety, quality, and production standards. This role requires intermediate 
							machine operation skills, basic preventative maintenance on saws and mobile 
							equipment, and the ability to troubleshoot and solve non-routine problems 
							effectively. The ideal candidate will demonstrate reliability, 
							critical thinking, and strong time management skills, with the ability to 
							work both independently and collaboratively within a team.</p>
						<p>Key responsibilities include performing routine maintenance tasks such as 
							lubricating moving parts, cleaning equipment, and tightening bolts, as well 
							as conducting inspections on mobile equipment. Operators must be adept at 
							gathering, organizing, and interpreting data to identify and address issues, 
							contributing to continuous improvement initiatives. This role requires intermediate 
							computer skills for navigating systems like MS Office, APICS, and SAP, as well as a 
							solid understanding of basic math for accurate measurements, quality control calculations, 
							and defect rate analysis. </p>
						<p>Those in this role must possess strong communication skills, demonstrate decisiveness 
							in making moderate decisions, and remain adaptable to changing priorities and conditions. 
							Forklift equipment certification is required, along with experience in loading and unloading 
							materials safely and efficiently. This position suits goal-oriented individuals who are 
							willing to learn and grow, embrace change, and consistently meet commitments in a fast-paced 
							industrial environment. </p>

						<h2>Saw 2</h2>
						<p>The Saw Operator II is an advanced role responsible for operating and maintaining saw equipment 
							with increased efficiency and precision, supporting production goals while upholding safety and 
							quality standards. Building on foundational skills, this role involves intermediate machine operation, 
							preventative maintenance, and troubleshooting tasks, with a strong emphasis on problem-solving and 
							critical thinking for non-routine issues. The ideal candidate will work independently and 
							collaboratively within a team to ensure operational excellence.</p>
						<p>This role demands effective time management, reliability, and a commitment to continuous improvement. 
							The Saw Operator II is expected to gather and analyze data to make informed decisions and contribute 
							to process enhancements. Key tasks include performing preventative and first-line reactive maintenance, 
							inspecting mobile equipment, and using advanced computer systems like MS Office, APICS, and SAP for 
							operational tracking. Forklift equipment certification and experience in safe loading/unloading 
							practices are essential.</p>
						<p>Proficiency in basic math is required to accurately measure dimensions, calculate percentages, 
							and interpret data for quality control. Operators will utilize hand tools for maintenance, 
							demonstrate self-awareness in their work, and embrace changes to improve processes and results. 
							The Saw Operator II role is designed for individuals who are goal-oriented, adaptable, and eager 
							to grow both technically and personally in a dynamic manufacturing environment. </p>
