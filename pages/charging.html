					<h2>Charging 1</h2>
					<p>The Charging Operator is responsible for managing and executing the preparation and 
							charging of raw materials into melting furnaces, ensuring efficient and high-quality 
							aluminum production while maintaining strict safety and operational standards. This 
							role requires a blend of technical expertise, strong time management, and critical 
							thinking to solve non-routine problems and implement process improvements. The ideal 
							candidate will demonstrate reliability under pressure, effective teamwork, and the 
							ability to communicate clearly with team members and supervisors.</p>
					<p>Key responsibilities include operating and performing basic preventative maintenance 
							on mobile equipment such as payloaders, telescopic lifts, and forklifts, as well as 
							conducting basic machine operation and hand tool use. The Charging Operator will gather 
							and analyze data to monitor processes, identify issues, and propose solutions for 
							continuous improvement. Proficiency in basic math is essential for measuring dimensions 
							and calculating quality control metrics, defect rates, and material quantities. </p>
					<p>The Charging Operator must have a strong commitment to safety, performing routine 
							inspections and maintenance on mobile and stationary equipment, including lubricating 
							parts, cleaning, and tightening components. Certifications for forklifts, telescopic 
							lifts, and payloaders are required, alongside basic computer skills for data entry and 
							using tools like MS Word and Excel. Self-awareness and adaptability are crucial, as the 
							role involves coping with changes and contributing to a goal-oriented team environment. </p>

							<h2>Charging 2</h2>
						<p>The Charging Operator II is an advanced role in the aluminum production process, 
							responsible for overseeing the preparation, charging, and monitoring of raw 
							materials in melting furnaces while maintaining a high standard of safety, 
							quality, and efficiency. This role builds on foundational skills and introduces 
							greater autonomy, decision-making, and leadership responsibilities, including 
							the ability to manage personal and team schedules effectively.</p>
						<p>In addition to operating and maintaining mobile equipment such as payloaders, 
							telescopic lifts, and forklifts, the Charging Operator II takes a proactive 
							approach to problem-solving and continuous improvement, identifying and 
							implementing basic enhancements to processes and equipment performance. 
							This position requires intermediate technical and critical thinking skills 
							to analyze data, solve non-routine problems, and ensure smooth operation 
							under pressure.</p>
						<p>Key responsibilities include performing preventative and first-line reactive 
							maintenance on machinery, gathering and interpreting operational data, and 
							using basic computer skills for data entry and reporting. Certifications for 
							forklifts, telescopic lifts, and payloaders are essential, along with the 
							ability to inspect and maintain equipment for operational readiness. 
							Proficiency in basic math, including accurate measurements and quality 
							control calculations, is critical for maintaining production standards.</p>
						<p>The ideal candidate demonstrates strong communication and teamwork skills, 
							embraces change, and exhibits self-awareness in managing interactions with 
							others. They are results-oriented, reliable, and capable of completing 
							intermediate tasks with a focus on meeting operational goals while fostering 
							a culture of continuous learning and growth.</p>
